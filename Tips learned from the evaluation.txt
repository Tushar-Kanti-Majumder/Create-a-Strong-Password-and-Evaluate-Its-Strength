Tips Learned from the Evaluation

1. Length is Crucial:

     Longer passwords are significantly more secure. Aim for at least 12-16 characters  . The longer the password, the harder it is for brute-force attacks to succeed.

2.   Character Variety Enhances Security  :

     Use a mix of   uppercase letters  ,   lowercase letters  ,   numbers  , and   special characters  . This variety greatly increases the number of possible combinations, making it harder for attackers to crack.

3.   Avoid Dictionary Words and Patterns  :

     Passwords that use   common words   or   simple patterns   (e.g., `"123456"`, `"qwerty"`, or `"password"`) are   easy targets for attackers  .
     Even   modified   or   substituted   words (e.g., `"P@ssw0rd"`) can be vulnerable to   dictionary-based attacks  .

4.   Randomness is Key  :

     Completely random passwords are far more secure than predictable ones. Avoid using familiar phrases, and instead focus on random sequences of characters.
     A combination of   random words  , numbers, and special characters can create a secure password that is still somewhat memorable.

5.   Unique Passwords for Different Accounts  :

     Using the same password across multiple sites or services increases the risk of   credential stuffing   (when attackers use your stolen password on other accounts).
     Always use   unique passwords   for each of your accounts to reduce the impact of a single account being compromised.

6.   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  :

     Adding   MFA   to accounts adds an extra layer of security, even if the password is compromised. This significantly lowers the chances of an attacker gaining access to your account.

7.   Avoid Common Substitutions  :

     Substituting characters like `@` for “a” or `1` for “I” is no longer sufficient for creating strong passwords. Attackers know these common substitutions and can easily guess them.

8.   Check Password Strength  :    
      Always test your passwords using   password strength checkers   to ensure they meet modern security standards. Aim for a score of   80/100 or higher on reliable tools.

9.   Keep Your Passwords Updated  :

     Regularly change your passwords, especially for sensitive accounts like email or banking. A good practice is to rotate passwords every   3-6 months  .

10.   Use a Password Manager  :

      A   password manager   helps store and generate strong, unique passwords for every account. This reduces the risk of reusing weak passwords and helps you keep track of them securely.
