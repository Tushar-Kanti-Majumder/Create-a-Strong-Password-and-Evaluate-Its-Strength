# Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength
In this task, I created multiple passwords with varying complexity to evaluate their strength and effectiveness in preventing unauthorized access. I incorporated a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and varied lengths to test different levels of security. I used online password strength checkers to assess each passwordâ€™s score and gathered feedback to identify weaknesses, such as common patterns and dictionary words. Based on this, I learned key best practices for creating strong passwords, such as using longer passwords, avoiding predictable words, and incorporating randomness. I also researched common password attacks, including **brute force** and dictionary attacks, and understood how these attacks exploit weak passwords. Ultimately, I concluded that password complexity directly impacts security by making it harder for attackers to crack or guess passwords. By applying these findings, I can now create more secure, complex passwords and implement strategies like multi-factor authentication to protect against potential breaches.
